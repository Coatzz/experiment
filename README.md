Welcome to the Tracer docs. You are currently at the _docs Portal_: a jumping-off point for the many spaces that describe Tracer and its components. Before you go exploring, why not read a little about the protocol?

## Intro

Tracer is community-led project that develops open-source software with a goal to standardise derivative contracts. Along the way, we hope to get derivatives into the hands of many more people than currently have access to them. &#x20;

Financial derivatives are, traditionally, a restricted asset class. But we think they are far too useful to prohibit people from using. For one, they let people manage risk and be more efficient with their capital. That alone should justify the need for universal access to these products.&#x20;

So, we are developing on top of the **only** platform that lets anyone access the contracts and promises to never shut down the agreements â€“ a public blockchain. At this stage, our code is written in [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org) for the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain, but we're only getting started. Have an idea for where we should go next? Hit us up on Discord:

> Here's a quick guide to the spaces you can access from the Portal:

#### Tracer DAO

Our fully on-chain organisation; where we raise funds, propose to change the old code, propose to add new code, vote on these proposals, engage talented people from all over the world to implement the proposals, and pay everyone who helps out along the way. &#x20;

#### Products&#x20;

Everything we've developed that you can use, operating forever on the blockchain.&#x20;

#### Security

Everything we've done (and are doing) to make sure that the code handling your funds is invulnerable.

#### Developers&#x20;

Our code, and all the stuff you can do to help make it better.&#x20;

#### Get Involved&#x20;
