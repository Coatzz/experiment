Welcome to the Tracer docs. This site is a portal to the many spaces that describe Tracer and its components. It has links to everything you need to know about the project.&#x20;

Before you go off exploring, let us tell you about Tracer. Tracer is community-led project that develops open-source software with a goal to standardise derivative contracts. Along the way, we hope to get derivatives into the hands of many more people than can currently have access to them. &#x20;

Financial derivatives are, traditionally, a restricted asset class. But we think they are far too useful to prohibit people from using. They let people manage risk and unlock more opportunities for people to profit from their beliefs. These contracts make money and markets more efficient, so we are building them on the only platform where everyone can access them and they can't be shut down â€“ public blockchains.&#x20;

Here's a quick guide to the spaces:

#### Tracer DAO

Our fully on-chain organisation, where we raise funds, propose to change the old code, propose to add new code, vote on those proposals, engage talented people from all over the world to implement the proposals, and pay everyone who helps out along the way. &#x20;

#### Products&#x20;

Everything we've developed that you can use.&#x20;

#### Security

Everything we've done (and are doing) to make sure that the code handling your funds is invulnerable.

#### Developers&#x20;

Our code and all the stuff you can do to make it better.&#x20;

#### Get Involved&#x20;
