# Build on Tracer

Tracer is a composable piece of infrastructure that can be integrated into any application. In addition to providing a set of audited contracts tested in practice, Tracer provides help with aspects such as market making, co-marketing, data availability, and parameter optimisation.

> With Tracer, you are not alone. Develop using Tracer's contracts and we'll support you throughout your journey.

The Tracer product suite currently consists of the Perpetual Pools template. The infographic below helps you determine whether Perpetual Pools are the right contract for your application.
